# ðŸŒŸ Day 30/333 â€“ Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

Explored the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** 

## Key Points
- **Sampling distribution of the mean** approaches a normal distribution as sample size increases.
- Works **regardless of the original data distribution**.
- Enables **confidence intervals** and **hypothesis testing**.
- Useful for **A/B testing, predictive modeling, and data-driven decisions**.


- **Practical Example:** Here i used daily COVID-19 cases and apply CLT then find some insights:
- Original daily COVID-19 cases are **skewed** and not normally distributed.  
- By repeatedly sampling and calculating **sample means**, the distribution of means becomes **approximately normal**.  
- This demonstrates the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** in action, showing normality emerges regardless of the original data shape.  
- CLT enables **confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and data-driven insights** from real-world samples.
## Insights
The CLT is a cornerstone of statistics that allows us to make predictions about population behavior from sample data. It is foundational for building reliable models and interpreting real-world data effectively.
