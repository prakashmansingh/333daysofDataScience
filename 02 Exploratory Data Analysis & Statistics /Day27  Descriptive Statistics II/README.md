# 🌟 Day 27/333 – Percentiles, Quartiles & Outlier Detection  


---

  
- **Percentiles**: Values that indicate the relative standing of data points in a dataset (e.g., 25th percentile means 25% of data is below this value).  
- **Quartiles**: Special percentiles that divide the data into four equal parts:  
  - **Q1** = 25th percentile  
  - **Q2 (Median)** = 50th percentile  
  - **Q3** = 75th percentile  
- **Five Number Summary**: A concise summary of data using Min, Q1, Median, Q3, and Max.  
- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: The range of the middle 50% of the data (Q3 – Q1).  
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifying values that lie far outside the typical range of data using the IQR method.  


## 🎯 Tasks Completed  
1. Calculated **percentiles and quartiles** to understand data distribution.  
2. Constructed the **Five Number Summary** for a quick overview of the dataset.  
3. Applied the **IQR method** to detect unusual rainfall values.  
4. Removed extreme values to create a **cleaner, more reliable dataset**.  
5. Visualized the effect of outlier removal using **Boxplots and Scatter Plots**.

Outlier detection is not just about removing “wrong” values; it’s about ensuring that the **story your dataset tells is accurate and meaningful**. By identifying and handling outliers thoughtfully, data analysis becomes more reliable and insightful.
