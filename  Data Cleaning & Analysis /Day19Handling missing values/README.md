# 🌟 Day 19/333 – Restarting Strong!  

After completing the foundations of **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, I’m continuing my 🚀 **#333DaysOfDataScience** journey from today.  

From here, I’ll be diving into one of the most important parts of my learning:  
**Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – the stage where raw data is turned into meaningful insights.**  

---

## 🎯 Today’s Focus  
- Understanding how to handle **missing values** in real-world datasets.  
- Exploring different strategies like:  
  - **Dropping** missing values.  
  - **Imputing** (mean/median/mode).  
  - **Forward/Backward filling** for sequential data.  

---

## 🔍 Why It Matters  
- Clean data ensures **better insights**.  
- Prevents errors during **analysis & modeling**.  
- Sets the foundation for **robust machine learning pipelines**.
