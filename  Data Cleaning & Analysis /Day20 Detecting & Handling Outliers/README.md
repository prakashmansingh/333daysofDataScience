# 🚀 Day 20/333 – Detecting & Handling Outliers  

 I explored one of the most important steps in **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – **Outlier Detection & Handling**.  

Outliers can significantly affect **statistical analysis** and **machine learning models**, making it crucial to identify and treat them properly.  

---

## 🔍 What I Learned  
- **Outlier Detection**: Using statistical methods (IQR, Z-score) and visualization (boxplots, scatterplots).  

---

## 🛠 Outlier Handling Techniques  

1. **Removal** – Delete extreme values that are likely noise.  
2. **Capping (Winsorization)** – Replace extreme values with upper/lower percentile thresholds.  
3. **Transformation** – Apply log, square root, or Box-Cox transformations to reduce skewness.  
4. **Binning** – Group values into ranges to minimize the effect of outliers.  
5. **Imputation** – Replace outliers with mean, median, or mode.

## 🎯 Why It Matters  
- Improves **model accuracy** and **robustness**.  
- Prevents misleading insights in **data analysis**.  
- Ensures better **generalization** of ML models.
